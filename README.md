<strong>Groovy</strong> is an application for music lovers and especially vinyl collectors.
With Groovy you can organize your collection of vinyls, and you will always know how many vinyls you own.
You can also create playlists, to make your collections looks like you want.
The second important thing is that you can exchange your vinyl with other vinyl from users's collections.
A perfect way to make your collection grow without spending too much money.
